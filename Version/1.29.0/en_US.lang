jenny.body0=In the Pokémon world you can find different things that will help you on your journey to become the best trainer! Some of them are:\n\n-Structures: You can find villages scattered around the world! All of them contain a Pokémon Center, houses and crops with special and useful plants, in addition to the inevitable Villagers. Each village will have a special structure, which you can review later.\n\n-Minerals: You can also find special minerals when you go to the caves that will contain very interesting and valuable items! Some of these objects will help you evolve your Pokémon or for the Rotom-Communicator missions.\n\n-PokéStops: Every so often attractive objects called "PokéStops" appear around the world. You will know how to identify them immediately! The more you hit them, the more bubbles they will release. Pop all the bubbles before they disappear!\n\n-Hoopa Rings: You can also find strange flying rings; If you hit them, a random Pokémon will appear, but if you're holding a Legendary Offering, a Legendary Pokémon will appear for sure!
jenny.body1=Special Structures are buildings within new villages, each of which serves a specific purpose:\n\n-Casino: A place where you can obtain the most valuable items! You can buy tokens or win them at slot machines.\n\n-Lab: A building where you can find the Pokémon Professor! This location also has machines that will be very useful for your adventure.\n\n-Gyms: A place that will test you! Defeat Gym Leaders to obtain their badges. The more badges you have, the better discounts you'll receive in the shop.
jenny.body2=Battling is a popular recreational activity around here! Here's the most important thing you should know about battling:\n\n-Starting a Battle: To start a battle, you must hit the trainer or the Pokémon you want to battle. But if you're going to participate against another player you'll have to choose it from your Pokédex menu and send a request manually! If you have just battled a trainer, you will need to wait 5 minutes before battling again.\n\n-Attacks: Choose the attack you want to use against your opponent. You can find out its damage, accuracy and effect from the Move Dex!\n\n-HP: Health points, better known as HP, are the amount of health your Pokémon has. You can restore it with the use of potions and some berries, and if your HP reaches 0 your Pokémon will be fainted. You can revive it using a Revive or a Max Revive, and if you want to revive a fainted Pokémon that is not participating in the battle you must choose it from the main menu of your Pokédex by having any of the aforementioned in your item bar.\n\n-PP: Power Points, better known as PP, are the number of times you can use an attack. If this number reaches 0, you won't be able to use that attack!\n\n-Using Items: You can use some items in a battle, such as potions, berries, and equippable items. But be careful! If you use an item, you'll waste that turn and won't be able to attack.\n\n-Rewards: Some Pokémon have loot that you can consume or use for your adventure. Trainers will give you money and battle badges. Gym leaders will give you a medal!
jenny.body3=Machines are items you can craft or find throughout your adventure. Each one has a specific function that will be very useful to you:\n\n-Rotating Market: It is a portable store that will be useful if you are very far from your base or a Pokémon Center.\n\n-Healing Machine: It is a machine that will restore the HP, PP and status changes of your Pokémon.\n\n-Storage PC: Here you can save and release your Pokémon, it has enough space and it is very comfortable to navigate its interface.\n\n-Personal Laboratory: It is a machine that will help you hatch Pokémon eggs, revive Pokémon fossils and analyze Mew's DNA.\n\n-Trade Machine: It is a very useful machine to exchange Pokémon with your friends. Some Pokémon need to be exchanged to evolve! If you don't have anyone to trade with, you can use a Union Cord to evolve certain Pokémon.\n\n-Rotom Communicator: This is a machine that you can use to complete quests for certain NPCs. They'll give you some nice rewards if you help them!\n\n-TM Machine: If you bought a TM from the shop, you can record attacks on it in exchange for some Battle Badges!\n\n-Slot Machine: This is the casino's star machine. Mastering it will earn you tokens that will be very useful for purchasing items from the casino manager.\n\n-Key Items: There are some items that only work from your item bar, such as the bike, both revives, the battle badges, and the mount finder. Some items are more specialized, such as the experience giver that you must wear, like a helmet.
jenny.body4=Pokémon are amazing creatures! They are invaluable companions that will quickly become your friends if you know how to train them wisely. Some things you can do with them are:\n\n-Battle: Your Pokémon will follow your orders in battle, the more battles you win, the stronger it will be.\n\n-Interact: If you hit with your Pokédex you can activate the mount option (You can check it in the Pokédex). In addition, if the necessary conditions are met, your Pokémon will be able to evolve!\n\n-Using objects: Some objects are used to interact, either to restore HP, PP, any status change, equip objects and evolve from an evolutionary stone or the Union Cord.
jenny.body5=NPCs are people who will serve you for different tasks. These are:\n\n-Trainer: An NPC who is capable of battling with you. Each NPC has a different difficulty level, and the harder it is, the better the reward!\n\n-Nurse Joy: A girl who will serve to refill your Pokévial's charges.\n\n-Shopkeeper: A kind gentleman who can sell you necessary items. You can also sell her your items!\n\n-Officer Jenny: I, of course, am the kind official who will answer all your current questions and any questions you may have in the future!\n\n-Casino Manager: The casino manager is similar to the Shopkeeper, but he can sell you more valuable items and you cannot sell him yours.\n\n-Professor: An experimental NPC; he doesn't yet have clear functions other than aesthetic ones. 
jenny.body6=Changelog for this version:\n\n-Charcadet's evolutionary line added.\n\n-Snorunt's evolutionary line added.\n\n-Pokémon spawns were fixed.\n\n-New abilities enabled.\n\n-Some evolutions fixed.\n\n-Damage bug fixed.\n\n-Casino prices changed.\n\n-Apricorn design changed.\n\n-Auspicious and Malicious armors were added.\n\n-More optimizations.\n\n-Minor bug fixes.
